# Resource-Management-System
This project is designed to store, manage and delete the data for the inventory, sale and production. It has to manage the data in these three databases. It has to be able to transfer the data between three different tables on the screen. The application has to be able to provide three tabs to go through different modules of the application. Each module has to show a different user interface depending up on the functionality. We have imposed different privileges for different people.
